<p>	My family, teachers, and friends all see very different versions of myself based on where and when I interact with them. All of them are various components of myself, but contribute to me as a whole.</p>
<p>	I asked my teachers and friends, “If you were introducing me to a stranger, how would you describe me?” Many of their responses made me laugh, but some of my favorites are,</p>
<p>	“A totally cool person who likes Greys Anatomy a little too much. You talk loud and fast, and are a little weird at times.” </p>
<p>	“一个吃货” (a foodie) </p>
<p>	"“An energetic person who is obsessed with boba and Starbucks.” </p>
<p>	“Tall older sister figure, who always helps out.” </p>
<p>	“Super duper fun and entertaining and you will never get bored with her. She also likes Gerber baby puffs and Chipotle and will care for you when you are at your worst times.”</p>
<p>	"“Although I haven't met Melinda in person, I can tell some things through her writing and her behavior in class. Melinda is very responsible and is never late with any of her work. She organized and self-assured. Melinda is brave because she shares her thoughts and has confidence to speak her mind. Melinda is unafraid of what others think, and she is happy to be happy. She has joy. She is very clear in her communication, and she offers interesting insights and observations of the world around her. She is strong and bright, and she demonstrates intelligence both in her school work and in her relationships with people. I think she has a lot of leadership potential.” (i have to edit this so its shorter i'm just too lazy to rn”</p>
<p> 	If you can’t already tell from the responses, one of the most known qualities about me is that I love food. I always come prepared with a variety of different snacks and supplies for any given situation and I’m not hesitant to share. I’m there for my friends when they need support the most, and I’m not afraid to treat them. I have their backs, and they are also there for me. Every relationship with my friends is unique, and the unique qualities of each friend allows me to better understand aspects of myself. Friends are some of the biggest influences in your life and I’m so grateful to have people who push me to be a better version of myself.</p>
<p>	In the classroom, I stay true to myself and my interests while taking initiative for my learning. Whether I am staying after class, setting up appointments to meet with my teachers, or emailing back and forth, I am resolute and determined to advocate for my education. My teachers would describe me as dependable, organized, and confident. </p>
<p>	Within my family I play the different roles of a younger sister, an older sister, and also a daughter. 	My brothers might say that I never come out of my room or interact with them, but don’t listen to them! They’re forgetting to mention my generosity with my snacks and money.😁☺️  My oldest sister, Lucy, would say that I am her baby while my second oldest sister, Aileen, refers to me as the sarcastic goody-two-shoes of the family. To my parents, I am their third daughter and the “good child”. In all seriousness, my family has seen me grow from a baby all the way to now, and they know almost everything about me. We confide in each other with our difficulties and help each other to the best of our abilities. </p>
<p> 	This is just a small snapshot of all the attributes I have to offer. Although I love who I am today, I’m also looking forward to the future, to becoming a better version of myself and growing as a person. </p>
